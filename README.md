# Image-Processing
 Implementing a line detecting program into an RC car using OpenCV. 
 Utilizing a video of “first person” video images that have been made available.
In the video you see the car driving between two red tubes.
The intention is that we can de red and on edits using image processing can calculate the angle at which the car is located using line detection.
These then become printed out and linked with a visualization so that I can effectively see the rotation of the car
